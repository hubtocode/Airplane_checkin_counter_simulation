# Airplane_checkin_counter_simulation

python code to simulate when passengers are generated by a fixed array

Suppose an airline check-in counter has two servers to serve two types of customers: business 
class and economy class. There are two lines in front of the servers: one for business class 
customers, and one for economy class customers. One of the two servers is designated to 
serve economy-class customers. The other server will prioritize business class customers, but 
will also serve economy class customers if the business line is empty. The counter is scheduled 
to operate from 4pm to 6pm, but will stay open until all customers have been checked-in. 
The whole system may be characterized by four variables: nb,ne,pb,ne
